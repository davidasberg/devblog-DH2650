Here I am going to document my development experience in DH2650, the fun stuff, the mistakes, and my thoughts on the progress.

This is my first update to the blog!

I almost forgot about this blog completely, so this first update will probably miss on some details on our first week of brainstorming. 

We are five people working on a game we're currently TechnoScourge. I'm not too happy with the name to be honest, but until we have something better it will have to do! The game is an isometric, top down, action rpg, procedurally generated roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic city with cyborgs. Whew. That's a lot of words. But it summarizes the game pretty well. Think Diablo, and Hades, and Risk of Rain, but the uniqueness of our game is the inventory/upgrade system. The player can grab parts from defeated enemies to upgrade themselves. This allows the player to make a unique build every run.

We're using Unity to develop the game, and are currently very early in development phase. Right now we have a player model, an enemy model and a start screen. 

I've been working on making an enemy the past few days, and I used some procedural animation to make a quadruped robot move procedurally without preset animations. It was maybe a bit overkill, but a fun challenge. 

A video of the effect can be seen below

Today we had our first demo, which, even though in very early stages, got some nice response. People seemed sort of impressed in a sense, and gave some nice feedback on where we should focus our efforts.

In the demo, we had some enemies that could fire at the player. The video below shows the effect.

The next step will be improving upon the player, making the mechanics and combat a lot smoother, as well as implementing the upgrade system and adding some more enemy types.

We had a meeting with Bj√∂rn yesterday and discussed the game a bit. It was a really insightful meeting, and I believe we learned more about our game from that 20 minute meeting than we did from 2 weeks of discussion.

The last few days I've been working on trying to make the game a little bit more *appealing* and nice looking.

I've also added a new enemy type!

Hopefully we will ramp up in speed a bit in the following weeks.

The course is nearing its end, and we are finishing up the game, the documents and the website. Sadly, the last few weeks have been really tough and not a lot of progress has been done. I spent the first few weeks working really hard, and making a lot of important progress for the game. Yet, it feels like no one else in the group really did the work they should have done. Then, about two weeks ago, two of our members said they are going *back to China*. We could barely get in contact with them for the first week, despite them saying they were gonna keep in touch and keep working on the game. I'm sad to say that this course would have been a lot more fun if we had more chemistry and worked better within the group. It feels like we've been fighting an uphill battle this entire time.

Despite what I said in the last post, we made some great progress the last few days. We merged an item drop feature which is really cool, and the demo is actually looking pretty good now. We're still missing some audio, like music and sound effects, as well as a proper player model. Since the demo is tomorrow it will be hard to get all of that done, but we'll see how it goes.
