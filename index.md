Here I am going to document my development experience in DH2650, the fun stuff, the mistakes, and my thoughts on the progress.

This is my first update to the blog!

I almost forgot about this blog completely, so this first update will probably miss on some details on our first week of brainstorming. 

We are five people working on a game we're currently TechnoScourge. I'm not too happy with the name to be honest, but until we have something better it will have to do! The game is an isometric, top down, action rpg, procedurally generated roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic city with cyborgs. Whew. That's a lot of words. But it summarizes the game pretty well. Think Diablo, and Hades, and Risk of Rain, but the uniqueness of our game is the inventory/upgrade system. The player can grab parts from defeated enemies to upgrade themselves. This allows the player to make a unique build every run.

We're using Unity to develop the game, and are currently very early in development phase. Right now we have a player model, an enemy model and a start screen. 

I've been working on making an enemy the past few days, and I used some procedural animation to make a quadruped robot move procedurally without preset animations. It was maybe a bit overkill, but a fun challenge. 

A video of the effect can be seen below
